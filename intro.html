    <p>Kings ruled the central plains of Sri Lanka from Polonnaruwa 800 years ago, when it was a thriving commercial and religious center. The glories of that age can be found in the archaeological treasures that still give a pretty good idea of how the city looked in its heyday. You'll find the archaeological park a delight to explore, with hundreds of ancient structures – tombs and temples, statues and stupas – in a compact core. The Quadrangle alone is worth the trip.</p>

    <h2>2. SIGIRIYA SRI LANKA.</h2>
    <p>Location-Central province,Sri Lanka. </p>
    <p>Coordinate-07°57′25″N 80°45′35″E.</p>
    <p>Elevation-349m(1,145 ft).</p>
    <p>Built for- King Kashyapa of Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Visitors-1 million.</p>
    <p>Governing body- Government of Sri Lanka.</p>


    <img src="1024px-Sigiriya_(141688197).jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Sigiriya rock plateau, formed from the magma of an extinct volcano, is 200 meters higher than the surrounding jungles. Its view astonishes the visitors with the unique harmony between nature and human imagination.

        The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined palace, surrounded by an extensive network of fortifications, vast gardens, ponds, canals, alleys, and fountains.
        
        The surrounding territories of Sigiriya were inhibited for several thousand years. Since the 3rd century BC, the rocky plateau of Sigiriya has served as a monastery. In the second half of the 5th-century king, Kasyapa constructed a royal residence here.
        
        After his death, Sigiriya again became a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century, when it was abandoned.
        
        The main entrance is located on the northern side of the rock. It was designed as a huge stone lion whose feet have survived until today, but the upper parts of the body were destroyed.
        
        Thanks to this lion, the palace was named Sigiriya. The term Sigiriya originates from the word Sihagri, i.e., Lion Rock.
        
        The western wall of Sigiriya was almost entirely covered by frescoes created during the reign of Kasyapa. Eighteen frescoes have survived to this day.
        
        Sigiriya frescoes depict nude females and are considered to be either portraits of Kadapa’s wives and concubines or priestesses performing religious rituals. Despite the unknown identity of the females depicted in the frescoes, these unique ancient paintings celebrate female beauty and have incredible historical significance.
        
        One of the most striking features of Sigiriya is its Mirror wall. In the old days, it was polished so thoroughly that the king could see his reflection. The Mirror wall is painted with inscriptions and poems written by the visitors of Sigiriya.
        
        The most ancient inscriptions are dated from the 8th century. These inscriptions prove that Sigiriya was a tourist destination over a thousand years ago. Today, painting on the wall is strictly prohibited</p>
      <p>Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of granite approximately 180 m high</p>

    <h2>5. Narangala Mountain,Badulla,Sri Lanka.</h2>
    <p>Location -UVA Province,Badulla.</p>
    <img src="WhatsApp Image 2025-04-12 at 23.17.26_06b2557d.jpg" alt=" Narangala Mountain">
    <p>Beautiful Narangala, with its golden grass, rises up to a height of over 1500m in the Uva Province of Sri Lanka. The summit of this second highest mountain in Uva, provides some of the very best views in the entire tropical island. In addition to it; the reasonable challenge that climbing it offers has made it a great favorite amongst hikers.

        Hiking Spot: Narangala Peak
        Height: 1527m
        Difficulty Level: Medium
        Things to wear: Hiking boots with a good grip, warm clothing
        Things to take: Water bottle, energy bars, bug repellant
        
        Route Description:
        The hiking trail starts in the Thangamalai Estate area. The name literally means ‘Golden Mountain’ in Tamil and is derived from the golden grasses that blanket the slopes of Narangala. One of the most defining features of Narangala is its sharply rectangular peak making it quite an attractive sight even from the far distance.
        
        Hikers should stop their vehicles at the Hindu Temple in the estate. If you have no guide with you, some of the locals will be happy to help direct. You will have to climb along little foot trails in the tea estate until you find a large pipe line that supplies water to the estate. You will then follow the pipe until the point hat it reaches a road that runs through the estate. There will be many pretty views of slopes coated in the bright green of tea trees; that you can take photographs of. After following the estate road for a while you will reach the point from which you start the climb up the mountain.
        
        The initial portion of the climb will be through a grove of turpentine trees. The leaf fall from these trees are very slippery; which added to the slope of the ground makes footing quite treacherous. The hike through the yellow gold grasses of Narangala’s slopes are idyllic though,
        
        making up for the difficulty in getting to them. There are occasional wildlife and their tracks to be seen; so go about without disturbing them. You will traverse four of the lower peaks of Narangala, all with great views, before reaching the summit.
        
        The vista that spreads before you will be jaw-dropping. You will be able to see between the valleys of the rivers of Uma Oya, Badulu Oya and Loggal Oya; while getting an eagle’s eye view of the Mahaweli flood plains extending all the way up to Trincomalee. Also to be seen are the far away Kehelpathdoruwa and Yahanagala mountains; Nayabedda Range, Madulsima Range and Poonagala Range; the Idalgasinna Gap and Haputale Gap; the slopes of Randenigala and rolling green of Horton Plains. The giant of the Namunakula Range of mountains lies much closer; with many other places to see and identify. These beautiful landscapes spread from the summit in colorful panorama; the likes of which are only seen in paintings.
        
        The summit itself has a flat area where you can rest and refresh before starting down. But make sure you don’t litter. The entire hike will take between six to eight hours depending on how experienced you are and how you pace yourself.</p>

     <p>Sir Thomas Villiers was awarded 2.8 ha (7 acres) from the Tangamale Strict Nature Reserve by an act of the British parliament. The house was built in 1931 by an English aristocrat and planter Sir Thomas Villiers, former chairman of George Steuart Co, a trading and estate agency based in Colombo. Sir Thomas was a grandson of Lord John Russell and descendant of the Dukes of Bedford. Named after Adisham, it was designed by R. Booth and F. Webster in Tudor and Jacobean style. Adisham Hall played host to many prominent personalities of the colony until the retirement of Sir Thomas, after which it was purchased by Don Charles Wijewardene and his daughter Rukmini Wijewardene, owners of Sedawatte Estates, in 1950. While studying at LSE, London, Rukmini Wijewardene, in order to thank him for the sale, made a courtesy call on Sir Thomas Villiers who was, by then, living in Knightsbridge, London. Don Charles and Rukmini were the husband and daughter of Vimala Wijewardene. In 1961 Rukmini Beligammana (née Wijewardene) sold it to an Italian Benedictan monk. Upon purchasing the house and property the Italian monk removed silver cutlery and a few items of furniture in order to recover his investment and also make a profit. After leaving it unoccupied for two years he subsequently donated the house and property to the Ampitiya Benedictine Monastery in 1963. The house is well preserved along with its period fittings and furniture, and is open to visitors.</p>

    <p>Sri Dalada Maligawa[a], commonly known in English as the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, is a Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the Royal Palace Complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. The relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The Temple of the Tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to the temple and the relic.

        Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters, conduct daily worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon and in the evenings. On Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is distributed to those present.
        
        The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989, and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. It was fully restored each time.</p>

Temperature fluctuates between 0'C and 27'C. It is rich in biodiversity and many species found here are endemic to the region.

    The Horton Plains are the headwaters of three major Sri Lankan rivers, the Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe. In Sinhala the plains are known as Maha Eliya Plains (මහ එළිය තැන්න). Stone tools dating back to Balangoda culture have been found here. The plains' vegetation is grasslands interspersed with montane forest and includes many endemic woody plants. Large herds of Sri Lankan sambar deer feature as typical mammals and the park is also an Important Bird Area with many species not only endemic to Sri Lanka but restricted to the Horton Plains. Forest dieback is one of the major threats to the park and some studies suggest that it is caused by a natural phenomenon.
    
    The sheer precipice of World's End and Baker's Falls are among the tourist attractions of the park.</p>
